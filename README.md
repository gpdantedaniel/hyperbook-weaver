# The Hyperbook Weaver 🕷️🦠

The Hyperbook Weaver is a topic modeling pipeline designed to semantically link all the papers found in the [Hyperbook](https://bioengineering.hyperbook.mcgill.ca/), a website maintained by McGill University's [Bioengineering Department](https://www.mcgill.ca/bioengineering/) that hosts a number of student papers from the course [BIEN 200](https://coursecatalogue.mcgill.ca/courses/bien-200/index.html). Using LLM embeddings, it establishes links between papers by finding common topics.
