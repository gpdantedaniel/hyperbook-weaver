Basic prokaryotic cells allegedly diverged into eukaryotes, and chloroplasts that produce oxygen later appeared. The first organisms with functioning chloroplasts are presumed to be a kind of marine algae. The genus of interest in this essay, Chlamydomonas, is known to be among these first algae ancestors. It comprises an important range of species across a wide range of environments. The species that will be primarily investigated in this essay is Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, an intensely studied species of Chlamydomonas considered to be a ‘model organism’ by the scientific community. The essay will analyze Chlamydomonas through  mechanics and physical phenomena, in an attempt to understand how this ancient organism has succeeded in thriving on earth with its interactions with the surrounding environment."

Having evolved from the unicellular Chlamydomonas, Volvox demonstrates that multicellularity is of particular interest to improve the nutrient uptake per somatic cell. Also, randomness plays a role in the self-assembly of cells in an almost perfect spherical shape which has the lowest fractal dimension, making it energetically ideal. Moreover, modeling of the colony’s motion highlighted that the species’ swimming technique is remarkably effective in their low Reynolds number environments. Finally, a mathematical approach of Volvox’s inversion facilitates the understanding of this complex process. All in all, the extraordinary properties of this microorganism both provide an insight into the driving forces behind multicellularity, and inspiration for biomimicking innovations."

This paper dives deep within Volvox to tackle the key chemical phenomena responsible for the basic functioning of the colony. The chemical processes involved in Volvox reproduction are based on protein-protein interactions and a sex inducer glycoprotein, enabling them to switch between asexual or sexual reproduction depending on their environment. The colony also optimizes its energy storage regardless of the level of oxygen in its surroundings via its hydrogen-based metabolism. Moreover, the extracellular matrix guarantees protection and flexibility of the colony thanks to its hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins and their entanglement. And of course, like many other organisms, Volvox generates energy through photosynthesis. This paper’s study of the ways Volvox employs chemistry to define its structure and satisfy its needs once again demonstrates its uniqueness in the natural world and has revealed further design solutions to the challenges that arise within its aqueous environment."
https://bioengineering.hyperbook.mcgill.ca/the-biophysics-of-volvox/,The Biophysics of Volvox,"Volvox are microscopic colonial algae that are heavily studied as they are one of the simplest examples of multicellular organisms. Composed of hundreds to tens of thousands of individual cells moving in harmony, they are the source of several mesmerizing phenomena, each of them serving a purpose for the survival of the colony. This essay describes the main biophysical properties of Volvox that have allowed this organism to thrive in its aquatic environment for so long without having to undergo considerable evolutionary change. First, the modalities of the colony’s flagellar synchronization through hydrodynamic interactions will be studied and pave the way to explain how Volvox can perform hypnotizing dances. Then, its ability to orient its motion towards light and collect it efficiently will be covered. Lastly, we will complete our analysis with how a Volvox colony’s life cycle starts, by exploring the dynamics of the process by which its embryo turns itself inside out. The complexity of these characteristics makes their understanding challenging. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the benefits they bring to the organism to convert assumptions into explanations, and possibly into design solutions."

The idea of symmetry is the core of this investigation, highlighting how radial and bilateral formations in Radiolaria are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also crucial for evolutionary efficiency in energy usage and genetic coding. Furthermore, these structures can be mathematically modelled via Voronoi tessellations, Euler’s theorem, and geodesic sphere models. These models are essential for understanding the complex geometries and structural robustness of radiolarian skeletons. However, to perform these geometric analyses, sophisticated imaging methods such as sub-micrometer X-ray tomography are employed, which provide insight on the organisms‘ complex structures and evolutionary adaptations at the nanoscale. In particular, the examination of geometric transformations in Radiolaria offers a window into the evolutionary history of these ancient organisms, shedding light on their morphological changes and adaptability over millions of years."
